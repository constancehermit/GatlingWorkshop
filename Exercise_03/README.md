# Exercise 3: Simulation
> Here's where we define how many virtual users will be executing our scenario, and how fast they should come into being. 

## Goal
- Understand injection profiles for scenarios

## Exercises
### Debugging 
- Run the simulation in this directory. You should get an error!
- Open the file the compiler found the error in.
- Something wasn't found. Fix this using an import. 
### Inject more Users into the Scenario
- Add another injection step, adding 5 virtual users over 5 seconds 
- (optional) [Read about Open vs Closed Models](https://gatling.io/docs/current/general/simulation_setup/)
